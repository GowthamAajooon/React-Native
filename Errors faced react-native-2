WARNING: We recommend using PowerShell or Bash via WSL 2 for development with Expo CLI on Windows. You may encounter issues using cmd.exe.

Enabled experimental React Native Directory checks. Unset the EXPO_DOCTOR_ENABLE_DIRECTORY_CHECK environment variable to disable this check.
✔ Check package.json for common issues
✔ Check Expo config for common issues
✔ Check native tooling versions
✔ Check for common project setup issues
✔ Check dependencies for packages that should not be installed directly
✔ Check npm/ yarn versions
✔ Check for issues with Metro config
✖ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
✔ Check if the project meets version requirements for submission to app stores
✖ Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
✔ Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
✔ Check for legacy global CLI installed locally
✔ Check that native modules do not use incompatible support packages
✖ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
✖ Check that native modules use compatible support package versions for installed Expo SDK

Detailed check results:

Expected package metro@^0.81.0
Found invalid:
  metro@0.80.12
  (for more info, run: npm why metro)
Expected package metro-resolver@^0.81.0
Found invalid:
  metro-resolver@0.80.12
  (for more info, run: npm why metro-resolver)
Expected package metro-config@^0.81.0
Found invalid:

  (for more info, run: npm why metro-config)
Advice: Upgrade dependencies that are using the invalid package versions.

This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, userInterfaceStyle, splash, ios, android.

Advice: Add '/android' and '/ios' to your .gitignore file if you intend to use CNG / Prebuild. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/#usage-with-eas-build

The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
Unmaintained: react-native-datepicker
No metadata available: @expo/metro-runtime, @react-native-community/masked-view, bcrypt, body-parser, cors, express, moment-timezone, mysql2
Advice:
- Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
- Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.
- Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.

The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
  @expo/metro-runtime@3.2.3 - expected version: ~4.0.1
  @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@2.1.0 - expected version: 1.23.1

Using EAS CLI without version control system is not recommended, use this mode only if you know what you are doing.
💡 The following process will configure your iOS and/or Android project to be compatible with EAS Build. These changes only apply to your local project files and you can safely revert them at any time.

√ Which platforms would you like to configure for EAS Build? » Android

🎉 Your project is ready to build.

- Run eas build when you are ready to create your first build.
- Once the build is completed, run eas submit to upload the app to app stores.
- Learn more about other capabilities of EAS Build: https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction

Enabled experimental React Native Directory checks. Unset the EXPO_DOCTOR_ENABLE_DIRECTORY_CHECK environment variable to disable this check.
✔ Check package.json for common issues
✔ Check Expo config for common issues
✔ Check native tooling versions
✔ Check for common project setup issues
✔ Check dependencies for packages that should not be installed directly
✔ Check npm/ yarn versions
✔ Check for issues with Metro config
✖ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
✔ Check if the project meets version requirements for submission to app stores
✖ Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
✔ Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
✔ Check that native modules do not use incompatible support packages
✔ Check for legacy global CLI installed locally
✔ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
✔ Check that native modules use compatible support package versions for installed Expo SDK

Detailed check results:

This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, userInterfaceStyle, splash, ios, android.

Advice: Add '/android' and '/ios' to your .gitignore file if you intend to use CNG / Prebuild. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/#usage-with-eas-build

The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
Unmaintained: react-native-datepicker
No metadata available: @expo/metro-runtime, @react-native-community/masked-view, bcrypt, body-parser, cors, express, moment-timezone, mysql2
Advice:
- Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
- Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.
- Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.
